# The Procyon Project

**Procyon** intends to provide a set of clients for social and aggregation platforms in order to
make it easier for everyone to find and access their favorite space in the **Fediverse**.

It dates back to 2023 with a Lemmy client and was extended with a Friendica (Mastodon-compatible)
client in 2024.

## What's in a name?

Raccoons are adorable, aren't they? Such cute and intelligent animals deserve more recognition!

The original Lemmy app was called **Raccoon**, following a tradition according to which Lemmy
clients were named after small mammals (Lemmur, Jerboa, Fennec, etc.). The idea was so nice that
it became natural to name the Friendica client after it.

The ü¶ù philosophy can be summarized in four simple words: ¬´Live Fast Eat Trash¬ª.
