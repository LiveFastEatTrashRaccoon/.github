# The Procyon Project
--- 
Procyon is a project which is intended to provide a set of clients for social and aggregation
platforms to make it easier for everyone to access their favorite space in the Fediverse.

The project started in 2023 with a Lemmy client, after the great migration of users from non-free
commercial platforms â€“ and was extended in 2024 with a Friendica (Mastodon-compatible) client.

## What's in a name?

Raccoons are adorable, aren't they? Such cute and intelligent animals surely deserve more
recognition in the world! The scientific name of the species is _procyon lotor_, hence the
inspiration for the project name.

The original Lemmy app was called **Raccoon**, following a tradition according to which Lemmy
clients were named after small mammals (Lemmur, Jerboa, Fennec just to mention a few and the logo of
the platform itself represents a lemming); then as time passed by the idea of having a raccoon-ish
app to access the Lemmyverse became a reality, and the dream of extending it to a set of tools to
access other federated platforms started to gain more and more prominence.

## Rationale

As most developers who are involved in creating the Fediverse, we believe that the principle of
freedom of speech and freedom of access to unbiased information is crucial for the development of a
healthy society in which individuals can grow together and inspire each other.

The access to information and the ability to create and discuss about contents freely gains even
more importance as there are instances, in different parts of the world and due to different
political reasons, to put more and more limitations and barriers to it.

Why Lemmy and why Friendica? The choice is not random, as you may imagine. The _trait d'union_
between the two platforms is that they are the only ones which support ActivityPub groups. Lemmy
communities are, just like Friendica group accounts, the Fediverse equivalent of forums or
distribution lists: users can subscribe to them and access a list of topics, each of which is the
root of a thread.

Considering the above statement about freedom of expression and the idea that growth stems from
discussion (and sometimes even argument) between people, it was natural to put a focus on this kind
of interactions.
