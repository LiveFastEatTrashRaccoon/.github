# The Procyon Project

**Procyon** intends to provide a set of clients for social and aggregation platforms in order to
make it easier for everyone to find and access their favorite space in the **Fediverse**.

It dates back to 2023 with a Lemmy client and was extended with a Friendica (Mastodon-compatible)
client in 2024.

## What's in a name?

Raccoons are adorable, aren't they? Such cute and intelligent animals deserve more recognition!

The original Lemmy app was called **Raccoon**, following a tradition according to which Lemmy
clients were named after small mammals (Lemmur, Jerboa, Fennec, etc.). The idea was so nice that
it became natural to name the Friendica client after it.

The ü¶ù philosophy can be summarized in four simple words: ¬´Live Fast Eat Trash¬ª.

## Rationale

As most developers involved in the creation of the Fediverse, we believe that the principles of
_freedom of speech_ and _access to unbiased information_ are crucial for the development of a
healthy society where individuals can grow together and inspire each other.

Being able to access and discuss about contents gains even more prominence as there are
instances, originating in several parts of the world under different political contexts, to
put more and more limitations and barriers to it.

Why Lemmy and why Friendica? The _trait d'union_ between the these platforms is that they
support ActivityPub groups i.e. the Fediverse's equivalent of forums: users can subscribe to
them, access a list of topics, create new threads or access the existing ones and post replies.

Considering the above statement about freedom of expression and the idea that growth stems from
discussion (sometimes even argument) between people, it was natural to put a focus on this kind
of interactions.
