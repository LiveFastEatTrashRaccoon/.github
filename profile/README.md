# The Procyon Project
--- 
**Procyon** intends to provide a set of clients for social and aggregation platforms in order to
make it easier for everyone to find and access their favorite space in the **Fediverse**.

It dates back to 2023 with a Lemmy client and was extended with a Friendica (Mastodon-compatible)
client in 2024.

## What's in a name?

Raccoons are adorable, aren't they? Such cute and intelligent animals deserve more recognition!

The original Lemmy app was called **Raccoon**, following a tradition according to which Lemmy
clients were named after small mammals (Lemmur, Jerboa, Fennec just to mention a few) â€“ the idea
got more and more traction and the same name was adopted for the Friendica client too.

## Rationale

As most developers involved in the creation of the Fediverse, we believe that the principle of
freedom of speech and access to unbiased information is crucial for the development of a healthy
society in which individuals can grow together and inspire each other.

Being able to access information and discuss about contents freely gains even more importance as
there are instances, originating in different parts of the world in different political contexts, to
put more and more limitations and barriers to it.

Why Lemmy and why Friendica? The choice is not random: the _trait d'union_ between the these
platforms is that they support ActivityPub groups i.e. the Fediverse's equivalent of forums: users
can subscribe to them, access a list of topics, create new threads or access the existing ones and
post replies.

Considering the above statement about freedom of expression and the idea that growth stems from
discussion (sometimes even argument) between people, it was natural to put a focus on this kind
of interactions.
